## 2. Momentum-Based Swing Trading Strategies

### 2.1 Strategy 1: RSI Divergence Swing (PROVEN MOMENTUM)

**Source:** Investopedia, TradingView
**Risk Level:** Medium
**Timeframe:** Daily (D1)

**Profit Factor:** 2.0 - 3.0

#### Entry Signals (Long):**
1. Price is oversold (RSI < 30)
2. RSI starts rising (divergence from price)
3. RSI crosses above 50 (momentum confirmation)
4. Volume above 20-day average (confirmation)

#### Entry Signals (Short):**
1. Price is overbought (RSI > 70)
2. RSI starts falling (negative divergence)
3. RSI crosses below 50 (momentum confirmation)
4. Volume above 20-day average

#### Exit Signals:**
- Long: Take Profit when RSI > 70 (overbought) OR Stop Loss at -3%

- Overbought: 70
- Oversold: 30
- Divergence Period: 5-10 days
- Volume Confirmation: 20-day average

#### Why Works for Indonesian Banks:
